## What is this Project
The objective of this analysis was to gain insights into the patterns and trends related to stolen vehicles in New Zealand over the time period of Jan ‘21 to March ‘22. By examining various factors such as vehicle types, colors, regions, and time periods, our goal was to provide a comprehensive overview that could aid law enforcement, policymakers, and the community in addressing and preventing vehicle theft.

The analysis provides valuable insights into the dynamics of vehicle theft in New Zealand. By understanding the patterns and contributing factors, stakeholders can develop targeted strategies to reduce theft rates, enhance security, and protect the community.

## Key Findings

  * Vehicle Type:
    
    Station wagons, saloons (sedans), and hatchbacks were the most frequently stolen vehicle types, possibly due to their popularity, commonality, and ease of resale.
    Light vans, boat trailers, and heavy trailers were the least likely to be stolen, potentially due to their specialized use and limited market for stolen parts.


  * Color Preferences:

    Silver, black, blue, and white were the most frequently stolen colors, likely influenced by their popularity, commonality, and high resale value for parts.
    Pink and yellow cars had lower theft rates, possibly due to their conspicuous nature and limited market demand.


  * Time of Year:

    The months from October to January exhibited higher car theft rates, coinciding with the holiday season, increased travel, and extended daylight hours.
    Factors such as vacation travel, warmer weather, and delayed reporting during the holiday season may contribute to the observed trend.
